Points to make
--------------
- Collaboration
- Attribution
    - who did that? ``git blame``
- Git is industry standard
- Not using VC is dumb
    - see: that time I deleted that file
- Aigaion replacement?
- Github/Bitbucket?
- Good way to collect project info so hand-offs are easier
- Did I mention data redundancy
- SVN sucks and no one knows what hg is so we use git
    - Mercurial might not be that bad of an idea, but I think git is a more valuable skill
- Using github/bitbucket for wiki and issues can also help preserve knowledge about a project
    - github allows us to make edits online, too, which is nice


Need to address
---------------
- learning curve
- Github/bitbucket privacy policies (and trusting a third party with research data)
- Storing pdfs
    - Or any other binary stuff. Word documents, graphics, and whatnot
- Converting legacy projects?
- Running a private git server?
