Points to make
--------------
- Collaboration
- Git is industry standard
- Not using VC is dumb 
	- see: that time I deleted that file
- Aigaion replacement?
- Github/Bitbucket?
- Good way to collect project info so hand-offs are easier
- Did I mention data redundancy 
- SVN sucks and no one knows what hg is so we use git
- Using github/bitbucket for wiki and issues can also help preserve knowledge about a project


Need to address
---------------
- learning curve
- Github/bitbucket privacy policies (and trusting a third party with research data)
- Storing pdfs
- Converting legacy projects?
- Running a private git server?
